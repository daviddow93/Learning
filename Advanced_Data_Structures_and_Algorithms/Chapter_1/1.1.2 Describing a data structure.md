The crucial part of an ADT is the set of operations that it allows.
This is equivalent to defining a contract with it's clients.

In order to provide an unambiguous specification:
- Specifying its API first, with a focus on it's methods's input and output
- Describing high-level behavior
- Describing in detail the behavior of its concrete implementation
- Analyzing the performance of its methods
