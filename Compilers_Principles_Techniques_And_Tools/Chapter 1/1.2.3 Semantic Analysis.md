The semantic analyzer uses the syntax tree and information in the symbol table to check the source program for semantic consistency with the language definition.

It also gathers type information and saves it in either the the syntax tree or the symbol table for subsequent use during code generation.

An important part of semantic analysis is type checking, where the compiler checks that each operator has matching operands.

For example, many programming language definitions require array indexes to be integers. The compiler must report an error if it finds an instance of attempting to use a floating point number to index an array, for example.
