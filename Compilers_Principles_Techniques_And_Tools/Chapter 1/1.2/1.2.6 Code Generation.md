The code generator takes an intermediate representation of the source program and maps it to the target language. If the target language is machine code, registers or memory locations are selected for each variable.  Then the instructions are translated into machine instructions that perform the same task. A crucial aspect of code generation is the judicious assignment of variables to registers.

Using registers R1 and R2, the intermediate code:

```
t1  = id3 * 60.0
id1 = id2 + t1
```

might get mapped to:

```
;load float id3 into register 2
LDF R2, id3

;multiply register 2 with #60.0 and store in register 2         
MULF R2, R2, #60.0  ;id3 * 60.0

;load float id2 into register 1
LDF R1, id2

;add register 1 and register 2 and assign to register 1
ADDF R1, R1, R2     ;id2 + t1     

;assign the value of register 1 to id1
STF id1, R1         ;id1 <= result of id2 + t1
```

This discussion has ignored important issue of storage allocation. They're discussed in Chapter 7, and storage allocation decisions are made either during intermediate code generation or during code creation.
