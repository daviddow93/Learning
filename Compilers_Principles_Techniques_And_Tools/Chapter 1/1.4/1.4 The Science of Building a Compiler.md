Compiler design is full of mathematical abstraction. This process is common: formulate a mathematical abstraction that captures the key characteristics of a problem, and solve it using mathematical techniques. The problem formulation must be grounded in a solid understanding of the characteristics of computer programs, and the solution must be validated and refined empirically.
A compiler must accept all source programs that conform to the specification of the language. This could be a program that's millions of lines of code. Any transformation that the compiler performs on the source language must be careful to preserve the meaning of the program being compiled. Compiler writers thus not only have influence over the language they create, but of all programs that are compiled with their compiler. This is why compiler writing is difficult (but also rewarding).
