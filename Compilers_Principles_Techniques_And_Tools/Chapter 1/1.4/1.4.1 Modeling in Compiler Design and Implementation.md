The study of compilers is mainly a study of how we design the right mathematical models and choose the right algorithms, while balancing the need for generality and power against simplicity and efficiency.

Some of the most fundamental models are finite-state machines and regular expressions (Chapter 3). These models are useful for describing the lexical units of programs (keywords, identifiers, et al.) and for describing the algorithms used by the compiler to recognize those units. Among the most fundamental models are context-free grammars, used to describe syntactic structure of programming languages such as the nesting of parenthesis or control constructs. Grammars are discussed in Chapter 4. Similarly, Trees are an important model for representing the structure of programs and their translation into object code (shall be discussed in Chapter 5).
