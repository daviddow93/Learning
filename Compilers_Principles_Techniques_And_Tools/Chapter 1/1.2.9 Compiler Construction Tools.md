Many tools have been created to help with the compiler design process.

These tools use special languages for specifying and implementing specific components, and many use sophisticated algorithms. Many of these tools hide the complexity of what they're doing and can produce components that can be integrated into the remainder of the compiler.

Some commonly used tools are:

1. Parser Generators - automatically produce syntax analyzers from a grammatical description of a programming language.
2. Scanner Generators - Produce lexical analyzers from a regular expression description of the tokens of a language
3. Syntax-directed translation engine: that produce collections of routines for walking a parse tree
4. Code-generator generators: produce code generator from a collection of rules for translating each operation of the intermediate language into the machine language for a target machine.
5. Data-flow analysis engines: facilitate the gathering of information about how values are transmitted from one part of a program to each other part. Data-flow analysis is a key part of code optimization.
6. Compiler-construction toolkits: that provide an integrated set of routines for constructing various phases of the compiler
