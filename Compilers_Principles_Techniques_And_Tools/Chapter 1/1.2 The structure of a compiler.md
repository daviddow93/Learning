In the previous section, a compiler was treated as a single unit that mapped a source program into a semantically equivalent target program.

There are two parts to this mapping: analysis and synthesis.

The analysis part breaks up the source program into pieces and imposes a grammatical structure on them. It uses this information to make an intermediate representation of the source program. If the analysis part detects that the source program is either syntactically ill formed or semantically unsound then it must provide an informative message to the user. The analysis part also collects information about the source program and stores it in a symbol table which is passed along with the intermediate representation to the synthesis part.

The synthesis part constructs the desired target from the intermediate representation and the information in the symbol table. 

front end -> analysis
back end -> synthesis

The symbol table is used throughout each phase of the compilation process.

Some compilers have a machine-independent optimization phase between the front and the back end. This phase may or may not exist in the compiler. The point of this optimization phase is to make the back-end program more optimized.
