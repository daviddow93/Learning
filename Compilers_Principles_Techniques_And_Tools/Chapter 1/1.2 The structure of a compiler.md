In the previous section, a compiler was treated as a single unit that mapped a source program into a semantically equivalent target program.

There are two parts to this mapping: analysis and synthesis.

The analysis part breaks up the source program into pieces and imposes a grammatical structure on them. It uses this information to make an intermediate representation of the source program. If the analysis part detects that the source program is either syntactically ill formed or semantically unsound then it must provide an informative message to the user. The analysis part also collects information about the source program and stores it in a symbol table which is passed along with the intermediate representation to the synthesis part.

The synthesis part
