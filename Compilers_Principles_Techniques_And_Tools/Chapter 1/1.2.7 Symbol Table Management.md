An essential compiler function is to record variable names in the source program, as well as various attributes of each name. These attributes may provide information about the storage allocated for a name, it's type, and it's scope (where in the program it can be used). In the case of procedure names, such things as number and types of it's arguments, the method of passing each argument (for example, by value or by reference) and the type of data returned.

The symbol table is a data structure containing a record for each variable name, with fields for the attributes of the name. The data structure for the symbol table can be designed to allow for fast lookup and storage of data to the structure. They're discussed in Chapter 2.
