Since the 1940s, there have been many new language features and computer architecture changes that have caused a lot of new demands on compilers. This has caused lots of new algorithms and representations to translate and support new compiler features.

Compilers help promote the use of high-level languages by minimizing the execution overhead of the programs written in these languages. Compilers are critical in making high-performance computer architectures effective. Compilers are also used as tools to evaluate architectural concepts before computers are even built. 

Compiler writing is challenging. A compiler by itself is a large program, but more modern langauge processing systems handle several source and target languages within the same framework. That is to say: they act as a collection of compilers. Good software engineering techniques are essential for creating and evolving modern language processors.

A compiler must be able to correctly translate the nearly infinite amount of possible source programs. The problem of generating the optimal target program from a given source is undecidable in general, and compiler writers must evaluate trade-offs about what problems to tackle and what heuristics are to be applied in order to generate efficient code.

This book is used to teach methodology and fundamentals of compiler design.
