The code optimization phase attempts to improve the intermediate code so that better target code will result. Usually better means faster, but other objectives could be desired (shorter code, code that uses less power, et al.)

Simple intermediate code representation followed by code optimization is a reasonable way to generate good target code.

An example of an optimization would (based on previous examples) would be to convert 60 to a floating point number at compile time. t3 is only used to transmit it's value to id1, so the optimizer can transform the previous code example of 

```
t1 = inttofloat(60)
t2 = id3 * t1
t3 = id2 + t2
id1 = t3
```

to :

```
t1  = id3 * 60.0
id1 = id2 + t1
```
