In the process of translating a source program into target code, a compiler may generate one or more intermediate representations, which can have a variety of forms. Syntax trees are a form of intermediate representation that are commonly used during syntax and semantic analysis.

After syntax and semantic analysis, most compilers will generate a low-level or machine-like intermediate representation for an abstract machine. This representation must be easy to produce, and easy to convert to the target language.

In Chapter 6, we consider an intermediate representation called three-address code, which consists of assembly like instructions, with three operands per instruction. Each operand can act like a register. The previous examples can be represented by 3 address code that looks like this:

```
t1 = inttofloat(60)
t2 = id3 * t1
t3 = id2 + t2
id1 = t3
```

Each three-address instruction has at most 1 operator on the right side. The compiler must generate a temporary name to hold the value computed, and the order of operations must be baked into it. Some three-address code instructions have fewer than 3 operands.
